              <h3>Why Copenhagen?</h3>
              <h2>Copenhagen, the city of Everlasting Hygge</h2>
              <p>
                Legend has it that Copenhagen earned its nickname from the warm
                embrace of its atmosphere, akin to a perpetual hug from a dear
                friend. Just like a comforting embrace, Copenhagen's story began
                with its cozy nooks and crannies, where locals sought refuge
                from the chill winds that sweep through the city. It wasn't
                until the 21st century, with a nod to its Scandinavian roots and
                a sprinkle of fairy dust, that Copenhagen affectionately became
                known as 'hyggens hjem' - the home of hygge. Today, Copenhagen
                wears its hygge like a badge of honor. Amidst the blend of
                historic landmarks, charming cafes serving up steaming cups of
                hot cocoa and delectable Danish pastries, and bustling markets
                brimming with artisanal crafts, you can still feel the gentle
                embrace of hygge in every corner. With every turn down
                cobblestone streets, you'll discover pockets of warmth – from
                the flickering glow of candlelit windows to the laughter of
                friends gathered around crackling fires – all enveloping you in
                Copenhagen's timeless and inviting embrace.

            <h4>About me</h4>
            <p>
              Hi! I'm Nour, a passionate globetrotter with a zest for
              exploration. Having called 7 countries home and journeyed through
              over 30 others, my wanderlust knows no bounds, and I'm not hitting
              the brakes anytime soon. My heart beats for the thrill of
              discovering new cultures, and there's nothing quite like immersing
              myself in worlds entirely different from my own upbringing.
